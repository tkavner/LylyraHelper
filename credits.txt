LylyraHelper was coded by @lyraohmi (discord) but there were many people who have helped along the way. This is the list of credits and thanks for other's contributions:

Viv for encouraging me to finish this helper module in the first place and for their help navigating more nuanced parts of the Celeste codebase.
Nerfred for making the scissor sprites and art help.
TiltTheStars for making the initial request for the Honeycomb Godrays.
Kataiser for the scissor sound effects
SJCord for generalized help and nudges along the way.
