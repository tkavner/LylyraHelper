LylyraHelper was coded by @lyraohmi (discord) but there were many people who have helped along the way. This is the list of credits and thanks for other's contributions:

Viv for encouraging me to finish this helper module in the first place and for their help navigating more nuanced parts of the Celeste and Everest code.
Nerfred for making the scissor sprites, laser sprites, and art help.
Kataiser for the scissor sound effects.
TiltTheStars for coming up with the idea for Honeycomb Godrays.
SJCord for generalized help and nudges along the way.
